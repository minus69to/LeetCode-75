## ✅ Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/minus69to/LeetCode-75.git
   cd LeetCode-75
   ```

2. **Browse to a topic folder** (e.g. `Stack`) and open the relevant file in your favorite code editor or IDE.

3. **Compile and run Java solutions:**

   ```bash
   javac OnlineStockSpan.java
   java Main    # (if there is a Main class)
   ```

   Or use your IDE's Run/Debug feature.

## 🧠 How to Use

* Pick a topic you want to improve on.
* Read the code and in-line explanations.
* Run the code with sample or custom test cases.
* Try to implement the solution on your own first before reading!
* Use the code as reference, but practice writing your own!

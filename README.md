This repository contains my solutions and notes for the "LeetCode 75" coding challenge. The aim is to master essential data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques, structured as folders by topic and technique.
🚀 Folder Structure

    Array-String

    Two Pointers

    Sliding Window

    Prefix Sum

    Hash Map-Set

    Stack

    Queue

    Linked List

    Binary Tree - DFS

    Binary Tree - BFS

    Binary Search Tree

    Graphs - DFS

    Graphs - BFS

    Heap-Priority Queue

Each folder contains C++ solutions for categorized LeetCode problems, along with explanations and comments where necessary.
🛠️ Language

    All code is written in C++.

📄 Files

    Each directory contains .cpp files named by problem, focusing on clarity and optimal solutions.

    0_test.cpp may contain example scripts or testing code.

🌟 Getting Started

    Clone this repo:

bash
git clone https://github.com/minus69to/LeetCode-75.git

Navigate to a topic folder and open the .cpp files.

Compile and run code using a C++ compiler:

    bash
    g++ filename.cpp -o output && ./output
